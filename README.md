# burger
* On loading the site the site queires a remote MYSQL server for information about the burgers to display. 
* The user can move a burger from the left side (the ready side) to the right side (the devoured side) by clicking the devour it button to the right of a burger in the ready list.
* The user can also add burgers to this database by entering their burger's name into the input field at the bottom of the page and clicking the submit button underneath that field.
* The functionality of the site is pretty simple but if something looks amiss feel free to bring it to my attention at https://github.com/dunkeltron/burger/issues
